And exactly one year later, here we are again.
It's time for my annual update. First off, a huge thank you to everyone who's enjoyed my projects. I know that the raw download number isn't a perfect measure of success, but doing more than double the downloads from last year is still a big achievement for me.

## Major Milestones
### Thunder
I promised NeoForge support for Thunder last year. Did I deliver? **Nope**.
And the only one to blame is me. I can say that I got sidetracked with other projects, that life got busier, or many other excuses, but at the end of the day I just procrastinated too much.
At least Thunder is still frequently updated and is getting more performant thanks to some new mods popping up at the end of the year that helped quite a bit ([Ixeris](https://modrinth.com/mod/ixeris) and [BBE](https://modrinth.com/project/ONZm0H7Y)).
Also, I'm doing a lot of benchmarks and tests to find the best settings for performance. Seeing how slow the process is, I'm building a Python tool to automate the process. Maybe I'll share it in the future if it's useful enough.
And I'm also planning on creating a spreadsheet with all the major optimization modpacks, to compare them and learn from each other.
But let's get back to NeoForge - I did experiment with it a bit, and the only real blocker was the fact that Yosbr was not compatible with Neo and that I had to rework the dev-tools to make it work.
Given the situation with Yosbr, I built my own mod to manage configs. Without any further ado, let me introduce you to...

### Config Manager
I built my first mod!
As said, it's a Minecraft mod that allows modpack developers to ship configuration files without messing with the user's preferences.
It's now published on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/jlNms3Jp) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-manager).
I thought that building mods would be easier, but (probably because of my super niche goals) it was quite a challenge. It took me something like 75 hours and a lot of headbanging to get it done.
At the end of the day, I'm quite proud of it. It works well and is already used in Thunder and surprisingly also in some other modpacks... Wow!
On the blueprint there's also a new mod that creates a modpack Out-Of-The-Box experience, but seeing how bad I am at keeping promises, I won't say anything more about it for now.



## Project Statistics
- Thunder is at 122K downloads on Modrinth and 8K on CurseForge
- Config Manager reached 113,000 downloads on Modrinth and 10K on CurseForge
- Modrinth total is at 319K and CurseForge at 21K (I've published everything there too now)

## Personal Growth and Technical Journey
[WIP]

## Looking Forward
Looking back at 2025 I can say that it was not a revolutionary year for me, but still a good one. I learned quite a bit and made some progress on my projects.
As the year ends, I want to wish you some rest and a steady start in 2026. 
Thanks for reading, I'll be back next year

And with that, the 2025 season comes to an End, Good Night!
